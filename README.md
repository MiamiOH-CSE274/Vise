Vise
================

Build a game that uses a 2D game board, and graph algorithms.

Background info
---------------
When designing a simple 2D board game, you have a major design decision to make: How should your represent the board? There are some obvious possibilities:

1. A 2-D array, one row per row of the board, using math to calculate neighbors
2. A 1-D array, using row-major order, using math to calculate neighbors
3. A graph structure made of node objects, each node object having 6 edges (up, upleft, upright, down, downleft, downright)
4. An adjacency list
5. An adjacency matrix

Your goal will be to complete the implementation of the game. If time allows, you should enhance the game by improving the graphics, adding animation, adding sound, or whatever other features you think would make the game more fun to play.

In fact, you may alter the rules of the game, if you like, to make it more fun. In that case please write up a description of your alternate rules. Be sure to include screenshots in your rules explanations.

Goals/requirements
------------------
There are a few main pieces of functionality you will need to consider when selecting your data structure.

1. Given a particular (x,y) coordinate, in board space, how will you find the appropriate item in your data structure?
2. How easy will it be to implement checkNbrs()?
3. How easy will it be to implement isConnected()?
4. How will you handle wrap-around? If the pieces go off the right side of the board, it should wrap around to the left. The top should wrap around to the bototm. *Note that my demos don't do this correctly!*
5. How will you do the "find the largest connected component" step in doVise()?

Questions
=========

#### 1. Which type of data structure did you choose? Explain, in English, the main ideas behind your data structure.

We choose an array of pointers to nodes, so an adjacency list. The main idea behind our structure was to make everything run in constant time after the board was initialized the first time. We thought that through using pointer manipulation during the initialization of our board we could avoid doing computations for locating indexes in the board during the game. 


Portfolio Video
=========

Explain your code, as you would to a boss or colleague in the workplace. You will most likely want to use a screen-capture software. You should, at minimum, do the following:

1. Show your program running.
2. Show your code, briefly explaining what it is meant to do. You do NOT need to explain any of the provided code, unless you made some meaningful change you want to describe.
3. If something is not working (or if you aren't sure), explain that part carefully.
4. Show some gameplay between two players.

The video should certainly be less than 2 minutes long. I (or the grading assistant) ought to be able to grade your program based solely on your video, so be sure that we can see your code style, and can accurately assess what works, or doesn't work, in your program. The "Questions" above might also be things you want to talk about in your video: The video should be able to be understood even by someone that isn't in the class, and hasn't read your question answers.

#### 1. Give the link to your portfolio video on YouTube.
